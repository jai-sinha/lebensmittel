## Overview
This is a pretty basic Swift/SwiftUI grocery and meal planning app. I built it because I live with my girlfriend now, and can no longer keep all my grocery lists, cooking plans, and monthly spending totals in my head only. This is just a way to easily distribute that knowledge, while avoiding using a Shared Note, which kinda sucked to use.
## Notes
I don't have Apple Developer Program money, so to this is distributed via AltStore, via my source: jai-sinha.github.io/lebensmittel/source.json. I didn't really build this with anyone else in mind, though, so it's pretty personalized; the AltStore is just so we can download it on our phones and receive updates easily without having to deal with weekly Xcode signing.

Also because I don't have Apple Developer Program money, the backend is hosted on a GCP e2-micro instance that should be free to run as long as I stay below certain usage limits. Another reason why I don't really have anyone else in mind with this project; I don't really want to have to scale this up or out.

The backend uses a web socket to keep both our apps updated as we each make changes to the shopping list or meal calendar, so the iOS app requires SocketIO, which in turn depends on Starscream; those should be the only frontend deps. The backend uses Flask and eventlet for the API/websocket functionality, and SQLAlchemy for the SQLite db.
